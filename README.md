# `tmle3`: Implementing Frameworks, Not Algorithms

> This is an introductory lecture on the [`tmle3`](https://tmle3.tlverse.org/)
> framework for Targeted Learning.

## Abstract

> Too often our software implementations of Targeted Learning are tied to a
> specific parameter or data structure or both. The `tlverse` seeks to resolve
> this by implementing the general Targeted Learning framework instead of a
> specific instantiation of it. Using the example of TMLE for treatment specific
> means, we'll talk through a classic approach to implementation, and contrast
> it with the approach used in `tmle3`.
